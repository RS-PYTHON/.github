# Reference System Python

The Copernicus Space Component *Reference System* is an open-source software solution allowing to implement, maintain, deploy, operate and monitor Sentinel data processing workflows based on the future re-engineered Level 0, 1, 2 [Sentinel Data processors](https://eopf.copernicus.eu/).

## How to find what you need

This organization has several repositories of different types.
Here, we categorise each repository as follows:

- üßô **Documentation repositories** to learn about the project and play with Jupyter notebooks
- üë©‚Äçüç≥ **STAC extensions** to extend [STAC](https://stacspec.org) capabilities
- üêç **Python repositories** to get client libraries, processing workflows and server applications
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Infrastructure repositories** to deploy the solution on a Kubernetes cluster

For more information on each repository, see its respective README.
